# BASIC QUESTIONS
# Which IATI publishers are currently publishing COVID-19 related activities/transactions? Which elements are they using?
#   Free text - activity title
# Free text - activity description
# Free text - transaction description
# Hum scope codes- GLIDE and HRP
# Tag element for development activities- vocab 99 with code= COVID-19
# Which countries is COVID-19 funding going to? (assess number of activities per recipient country)
# From all IATI members, how many are publishing vs not publishing? Which members are publishing vs not publishing?
#   Pick one specific member. Use as an example of publishing good data?
#   Can we track progress over time for publishers? Run a query to show increase of publishers and activities over time.
# Number of activities by reporting organization type
# 
# MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS
# How much money has been allocated to COVID-19 up to now? Track progress over the year. 
# Money allocated to COVID-19 = the money in transactions that are identified as COVID-19-related (canâ€™t be assume that all transactions within an activity are COVID-19-related)
# Could assess total commitments/disbursements in COVID-19-related activities and transactions vs total commitments/disbursement for the transactions we can definitively say are COVID-19-related (because the specific transactions are identified as COVID-19-related)
# Which activities and who is involved? What are the implementing agencies and how many activities are being implemented by each? What are the implementing agencies by recipient country?
#   Which sectors are COVID-19-related activities/transactions targeting?
#   Qualitative analysis comparing the activities!
#   Try to assess which activities appear to be 100% COVID-19-related and which are clearly not (e.g. UNHCR activities)
# What transaction types have been used? 
#   Do COVID-19-related activities activities already have disbursements?
#   Are the COVID-19-related activities newly reported/published activities or were they previously reported and now the COVID-19-related values have been added? Or can we get a breakdown of each of these? 
#   Are there old activities which are now being included as having COVID-19-specifc values but had been published previously?
#   Who are the key receiver orgs? Run the check by identifying covid-19 transactions and the searching for provider and receiver-org.
